Examine SpaceX launch and mission parameters to try and predict if the first stage can be recovered.

- Identify sources of data.
- Import the data into pandas DataFrames.
- Analyze the raw data to see the data types, missing values, descriptive statistics.
- Handle missing data by removing or estimating.
- Perform correlations to help to determine parameters that correlated with result.
- Modify data types as needed, i.e. convert strings to floats.
- Add one-hot encoding of categorical values as needed.
- Normalize / standardize data.
- Randomize samples and split data into Train, Validation and Test sets. Depending on size of data set, may need to use k-folds to get a good selection of training and validation.
- Before training, establish the metrics and desired outcome. A probability is better than a binary category.
- Try the simplest linear model first. This establishes a baseline and is easy to interpret.
- Try other more complex models to see if it can be improved upon.
- Select final model and publish results.
